use AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later
use scripting additions

-- This script converts the official new york election calendar found here into events in Apple Calendar. 
-- The original PDF file is here: https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/law/2022PoliticalCalendar.pdf
-- I used Adobe Acrobat to convert it to an excel spreadsheet, then opened it in Apple Numbers.
-- Then I used AppleScript to conver it to Apple Calendar
-- Once in Apple Calendar, you can export as an ics file or publish as a feed
